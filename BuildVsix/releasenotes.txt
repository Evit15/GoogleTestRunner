GoogleTest Runner v1.0  -  09/2013

 * Supports the discovery of unit tests written using GoogleTest framework in Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2013
 * Discovers test methods also from imported dlls (if you implement tests in libfoo.dll, but run them from libfootests.exe), so VS doesn't throw you into RT_MANIFEST
 * Supports projects whose output matches the regular expression "[Tt]est[s]{0,1}.exe"
   - The tests are discovered by running a matching executable with flag --gtest_list_tests

Compatibility:
 * Does not work with GoogleTest Adapter
     * http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f00c0f72-ac71-4c80-bf8b-6fe381548031
 * ReSharper8 might interfere with GoogleTest Runner in VS2012
     * https://bugs.launchpad.net/nunit-vs-adapter/+bug/1203587
     * Go to (VS2012 Tools | Options | ReSharper | Suspend)
 
Technical:
 * Written in F#
 * Uses Microsoft DIA SDK to read symbols from .pdb's
 * Some native calls to read dll imports from main executable
 * GoogleTest definitions TEST(FooSuite, FooMethod) creates a method named
    FooSuite_FooMethod_Test::TestBody for actually running the test, this is
    the one to look for when loading symbols
 * Test run results are saved to Path.GetTempFileName and read in using Xml Type provider
 * To debug the unit test adapter
   - Attach to process vstest.discoveryengine.x86.exe vstest.executionengine.x86.exe
